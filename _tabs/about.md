I'm Vibhaas, currently in my 2nd year of Computer Science Engineering at [IIIT Kottayam](https://www.iiitkottayam.ac.in/). I am a competitive programmer and programming hobbyist. I have varied interests ranging from Mathematics to Philosophy to Social Psychology to [interesting fanfiction](https://hpmor.com/) (:p).

Academically, I am a Coordinator for the [Coders Club at IIITK](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codersclub-iiitk/). I learnt to program in 2nd grade, and [dabbled](https://codepen.io/vibhaas) in programming as a hobby whenever I had free time. In 11th grade I won a [Bronze Medal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vibhaas/overlay/1714978989419/single-media-viewer/) in [INOI](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/), a competition to select the students who would represent India at the [Informatics Olympiad](https://ioinformatics.org/). I hold a title of [Expert on Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/accord).

At college, along with Coders Club Coordinator, I am currently serving as the Class Representative for my batch, as well as a member of the Mess Committee, [Literary Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/litsoc-iiitk/) and the [Enigma AI Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/enigma-iiitkottayam/). You can view my full resume on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vibhaas/).

On the philosophical side, I am strongly in favour of human augmentation and life extension, and consider myself a [Transhumanist](https://www.humanityplus.org/the-transhumanist-manifesto). I am interested in [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and [Longtermism](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/longtermism). I believe that [Existential risk from artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence) is currently one of [the most pressing problems for humanity](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk).

On hobbies, I enjoy playing chess, solving puzzles and math problems, and debating various topics. I enjoy watching anime and reading books, usually either non-fiction or sci-fi/fantasy. You can get in touch with me by shooting me an email at [vibhaas@gmail.com](mailto:vibhaas@gmail.com).
