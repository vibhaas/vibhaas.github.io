## Introduction

You just got admitted to your Computer Science (or some other science / engineering) degree, and you are wondering, but _how do I start to learn how to program_? Perhaps you are in high school, and notice some of your friends who are into coding and you think it looks cool. Or perhaps you want to automate the boring tasks in Minecraft and are learning AutoHotkey, and now you got interested in expanding your skills. 

This article is for you. Although it is primarily written for the first category of people, I believe it will be a valuable read for anyone learning to program.

If you _do_ fall into the first category, that I believe it will be valuable to read this post from cover-to-cover.

Although posted on my blog, this post has been a collabarative effort by many people. Special thanks to:

## About Me

This is section is here to answer the question: Why should you listen to what I have to say?

I am currently a 2nd year student of Computer Science and Engineering at [IIIT Kottayam](https://www.iiitkottayam.ac.in/). I am a Coordinator for the [Coders Club at IIITK](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codersclub-iiitk/). I learnt to program in 2nd grade, and [dabbled](https://codepen.io/vibhaas) in programming as a hobby whenever I had free time. In 11th grade I won a [Bronze Medal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vibhaas/overlay/1714978989419/single-media-viewer/) in [INOI](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/), a competition to select the students who would represent India at the [Informatics Olympiad](https://ioinformatics.org/). I enjoy competitive programming, holding a title of [Expert on Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/accord). You can get to know me better using the [About](/about) page.

As this post is written in my perspective, so naturally some of the advice will be more relevant to a similar section of people compared to others. I have attempted to mitigate this by keeping my advice as general as possible and the inclusion of other contributers.

## Before we get started

Before we begin our discussion about how to get started with programming, I want to provide you with some tips. These are things you should _not_ do while programming, and common pitfalls to avoid. Let's get into it!

### 1. Be self-reliant

First and most important, do **NOT** expect to learn how to code well from college (especially, in an Indian Engineering college). While you will learn how to code in college, it will not amount to much without spending a large amount of time in self-learning. Also, relying solely on college will lead to write bad code in an outdated programming framework, and it will make any competent programmer wince by just looking at it. Fortunately, resources to learn coding abound on the internet! We will discuss some in the [How to Get Started](#how-to-get-started) section.

### 2. Do not expect it to be easy

For unknown reasons, a lot of people expect coding to be easy, or they watch some youtube tutorials and assume that they now know how to code. Peter Norvig put it best in his essay (which I highly recommend reading), [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html):

> Walk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours alongside endless variations offering to teach C, SQL, Ruby, Algorithms, and so on in a few days or hours... The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about programming, or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else.

Let me make it clear: _Coding is not easy!_ Just like any craft, it takes discipline and delibrate practice over a long period of time to actually become a decent programmer. Do not expect it to be easy. Programming is vast, and to learn it to an intermediate level as a complete beginner, it will take you at least two years of practice. To become a expert programmer it may take you five, ten years, or more! I cannot say, since I do not consider myself one! So, you must develop a love for the craft, which is the only way to hone your skills to this level. It is important to keep this in mind.

### 3. Learn how to program, not any particular language

Most programming languages are very similar, like different dialects of the same language, rather than completely different languages.. Lorem Ipsum.

### 4. Syntax vs "knowing" a language

### 5. On Online Courses and Tutorial Hell

### 6. Write Clear Code

> "_Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to another programmer they would say, 'oh, that’s well written code.' It’s much like as if you were writing a poem._" ~ Santiago Gonzalez

> "_Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live._" ~ John Woods

## On Machine Learning and AI

This section on Machine Learning and AI was contributed by [Glen Enosh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glen-enosh-924414215) and [Harissh Ragav Dhamodaran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harissh-ragav-dhamodaran-b7a8aa289/), core members of the [Enigma AI Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/enigma-iiitkottayam/) at IIITK.

### Getting Started

> _AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there'll be great companies. - Sam Altman_

Ever feel like your Netflix recommendations know you better than your own family? That's the subtle magic of AI at work – and it's just the tip of the iceberg! Here are some tips and tricks, where we demystify artificial intelligence: it's less "_Terminator_" and more "your grandma asking Alexa to play '_Despacito_'" (it's a vibe).

Basics(Green):  Python -> Linear Algebra(Math) ->  Probability & Statistics(Math) -> Numpy()->MathPlotLib->Pandas (Implementation Library)

Intermediate(Yellow) :-Basic ML Algorithms(Regressions and Classifications(Core)->scikit-learn(Implementation Library )

Advanced(Orange) : Matrix(Math) -> Calculus(Math) -> Intro to Neural Networks FrameWorks(core): PyTorch, TensorFlow (Implementation Libraries)->(Misty Cloud) Research Papers, further AI libraries,etc….

### Some tips and tricks

- If you have prepared for JEE Mathematics, it should cover the maths in the roadmap. Just review the mentioned concepts.
- The roadmap is designed with the knowledge needed for each step.
What works for us may not work for you, but aim to complete most of the concepts in the roadmap.
- Try doing your logical work in the morning and your creative work at night.
- Don’t trust us. Jump to advanced levels, face challenges, get mocked by the lack of knowledge, and doubt your ability. It’s okay to feel so. Don’t give up. Return to basics to understand the necessity of following the roadmap.Return to basics to understand the necessity of following the roadmap.
- Take on tougher projects involving skills or domains you haven’t explored but are interested in. This can create an urge to acquire the necessary skills or knowledge. You can either clutch or crumble under pressure, but if you have genuine interest and urge, you will survive.
- The key to learning stuff in this specific field is not just consistency and dedication, you have to choose the pertinent subjects to dedicate your time to.
- If you ever feel like getting stuck in a specific part, take a break, chill and then come back to it with a different point of view.
- The learning curve in AI is steeper than cubic polynomials, the initial steps can be tiring and exhausting. So, Try implementing the stuff that you learnt cuz visual learning proves to be helpful in the long run.
- Don’t blindly follow the tutorials implementing the ML and ANN algos, try to understand the intuition behind the algo and then code it up.
- Don’t ask too many questions up front. Just dive in and get started!
