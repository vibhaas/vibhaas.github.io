## Introduction

You just got admitted to your Computer Science (or some other science / engineering) degree, and you are wondering, but _how do I start to learn how to program_? Perhaps you are in high school, and notice some of your friends who are into coding and you think it looks cool. Or perhaps you want to automate the boring tasks in Minecraft and are learning AutoHotkey, and now you got interested in expanding your skills. 

This article is for you. Although it is primarily written for the first category of people, I believe it will be a valuable read for anyone learning to program.

If you _do_ fall into the first category, that I belive it will be valuable to read this post from cover-to-cover.

Although posted on my blog, this post has been a collabarative effort by many people. Special thanks to:

## Before we get started

### 1. Be self-reliant

Firstly, do *not* expect to learn how to code well from college (especially, an Indian engineering college). You will not end up learning much, and even if you do, it will be how to write bad code in an outdated programming framework that makes any competent programmer wince by just looking at it.

### 2. Do not expect it to be easy

### 3. Learn how to program, not any particular language

### 4. Syntax vs "knowing" a language

### 5. On online courses and Tutorial Hell

### 6. Writing clear code

## How to Get Started

## On Machine Learning and AI

## On Cybersecurity

## Programming Challenges

### 1. Hackathons

### 2. Competitive Programming

### 3. CTFs

## Tips from batchmates and seniors

## Concluding Remarks
